	<h1>Various informations:</h1>

	The <strong>left</strong> end neuron layer makes the <strong>input</strong> neuron layer.<br/>
	The <strong>right</strong> end neuron layer makes the <strong>output</strong> neuron layer.<br/>
	<br/>
	Every time you <strong>unvalidate</strong> and <strong>revalidate</strong> a neural network, you lose all its apprenticeship.
	Processing mode on a non-learned neural network works but make no sense. (Thanks captain obvious!)<br/>
	<br/>
	The <strong>multithreading</strong> functionnality can significantly increase the learning speed only if used on big amount of data and/or big neural networs.
	Else, used on small amount of data and small neural networs, the multithreading can slow dows the learning speed.<br/>
	<br/>
	The learning algorithme stops when the MSE does not changes enough during _insufficientProgressionsNeededToStop iterations.
	The <strong>last interration progression</strong> (<strong>LIP</strong>) must be _insufficientProgressionsNeededToStop times in a row under the threshold given in the "Minimum progression per iterations" field.
	Setting the value of 0 for the threshold is equivalent to disable this funtionnality.<br/>
	<br/>
	The <strong>learning mode</strong> "<strong>Learn with a control sample</strong>" will make the neural network only learning the first half of the data in order to comute a potential error on new non-learned data.
	The comparing between the results obtained on the learned data and the non learnd data can be read in the displayed end learning message.

	<h1>Learning mode:</h1>

	To enter in the <strong>learning</strong> mode :

	<ul>
		<li>
			have a validated perceptron
		</li>

		<li>
			load a table (a CSV file)
		</li>

		<li>
			you must have : N<sub>columns in the table</sub> = N<sub>input neurons</sub> + N<sub>output neurons</sub>
		</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Processing mode:</h1>

	To enter in the <strong>processing</strong> mode :

	<ul>
		<li>
			have a validated perceptron
		</li>

		<li>
			load a table (a CSV file)
		</li>

		<li>
			you must have : N<sub>columns in the table</sub> = N<sub>input neurons</sub>
		</li>
	</ul>

	After using the processing mode, the "Export this Table (as CSV File)" option int the "File" menu will be unlocked until you do something.
