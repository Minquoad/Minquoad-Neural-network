	<h1>Various informations:</h1>

	The <strong>left</strong> end neuron layer makes the <strong>input</strong> neuron layer.<br/>
	The <strong>right</strong> end neuron layer makes the <strong>output</strong> neuron layer.<br/>
	<br/>
	Every time you unvalidate and revalidate a neural network, you lose all its apprenticeship.
	Processing mode on a non-learned neural network works but make no sense. (Thanks captain obvious!)<br/>
	<br/>
	The multithreading functionnality can significantly increase the learning speed only if used on big amount of data and/or big neural networs.
	Else, used on small amount of data and small neural networs, the multithreading can slow dows the learning speed.
	
	

	<h1>Learning mode:</h1>

	To enter in the <strong>learning</strong> mode :

	<ul>
		<li>
			have a validated perceptron
		</li>

		<li>
			load a CSV file
		</li>

		<li>
			you must have : N<SUB>columns in CSV file</SUB> = N<SUB>input neurons</SUB> + N<SUB>output neurons</SUB>
		</li>
	</ul>

	
	<h1>Processing mode:</h1>

	To enter in the <strong>processing</strong> mode :

	<ul>
		<li>
			have a validated perceptron
		</li>

		<li>
			load a CSV file
		</li>

		<li>
			you must have : N<SUB>columns in CSV file</SUB> = N<SUB>input neurons</SUB>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	After using the processing mode, the "Save CSV" option int the "File" menu will be unlocked until you do something.
